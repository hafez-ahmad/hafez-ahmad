I am Hafez Ahmad and experienced in Project Management,Oceanography,Observational Oceanography,Marine Ecology, Geoinformatics and Remote Sensing, Strategic Planning, Data Analysis and Management, and skilled in Python, R, MATLAB, Julia,Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Office. I am passionate about Observational Oceanography, Marine Ecology Research and Coastal Development Research. I use Python and R, MATLAB ,and C++ for data analysis, modeling, and visualization. I like do research and work in the fields of  Observational Physical Oceanography, ,Ocean productivity, Biological effects on Ocean's optical properties,Coastal zone management,Coastal Climate hazards and distribution of temperature and salinity, Coastal , Deep-ocean processes, Acoustic Telemetry for Studying Migration Movements as well as computational Oceanography .I am currently working on Machine learning applications, Marine spatial Planning,and Ocean Tracking and detection.
I will be happy to be part of your Research Groups. I have a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Oceanography from the Faculty of marine science and fisheries, [University of Chittagong ,Bangladesh](https://cu.ac.bd/) and I am also an Exchange student at [Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida, USA](https://www.fgcu.edu/). More information about my Research and Activities can be found at my personal [Website](https://hafez-ahmad.github.io/HafezAhmadOceanographer.github.io/) where I like to write about Ocean, environment , Marine Ecology, climate and Numerical Ocean Data analysis. I love to study and write.
