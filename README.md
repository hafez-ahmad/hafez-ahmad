I am Hafez Ahmad and experienced in Project Management, Oceanography, Observational Oceanography, Marine Ecology, Geoinformatics and Remote Sensing, Strategic Planning, Data Analysis, Modeling, Visualization, Management, and skilled in Python, R, MATLAB, Julia, Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Office. I am passionate about Observational Oceanography, Marine Ecology Research, Hydrology , Aquatic wildlife and Coastal Development Research. I like to do research and work in the fields of observational Physical Oceanography, Biological effects on Ocean's optical properties, Coastal zone management, Coastal Climate hazards and distribution of temperature and salinity, Coastal, Deep-ocean processes, as well as Acoustic Telemetry for Migration. I am currently working on Machine learning applications, Marine spatial Planning, and Ocean Tracking and detection. I will be happy to be part of your Research Groups. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Oceanography from the Faculty of Marine Science and fisheries, [University of Chittagong, Bangladesh](https://cu.ac.bd/) and I am also an Exchange student at [Florida Gulf Coast University, Florida, USA](https://www.fgcu.edu/). I am currently Graduate student of [**Mississippi State University**](https://www.msstate.edu/).
